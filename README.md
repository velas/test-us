# Velas Test-us
Welcome to public testing of Velas Wallet products

Check 'Issues' to see if any test-session is currently open

### How to enter test session
- In this repository, go to 'Issues", you will see 'test session #.. is open [date]', if the test session is closed, this means we are not currently reviewing new bug reports
- Make sure an issue for new test session is open by one of 'test-us' repository contributers
- To apply for test session and receive your reward, leave your VLX address here: [test session google form](https://forms.gle/Ko1Zme7PubfYNYve7)
- If you have tested web wallet previously, it is recommended to reset browser cache to exclude old bugs (command+shift+R / ctrl+shift+R)

### Scope

- Full testing of all features available through Web UI and mobile applications. 
- with focus on main functionality that is relevant for a regular user in the context of his daily activities
